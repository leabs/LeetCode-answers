There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`, where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the `ith` kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` is `true` if, after giving the `ith` kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or `false` otherwise.

Note that **multiple** kids can have the **greatest** number of candies.

## Example

```javascript
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true]
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
```

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} candies
 * @param {number} extraCandies
 * @return {boolean[]}
 */
var kidsWithCandies = function (candies, extraCandies) {
  //Find the maximum number of candies
  let max = Math.max(...candies);
  //Return a boolean array where each element is true if the ith kid has the greatest number of candies
  return candies.map((candy) => candy + extraCandies >= max);
};
```
