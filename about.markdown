I'm doing the daily javascript challenges on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for the whole year. I'm using this site to document my progress and to share my solutions. This is a great way to learn and practice javascript.

I am not a JS wizard, so I'm sure there are better ways to solve these problems. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to comment on the post!
