# LeetCode Answers

I'm doing the daily javascript challenges on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for the whole year of 2023. I'm using this site to document my progress and to share my solutions. This is a great way to learn and practice javascript.

I am not a JS wizard, so I'm sure there are better ways to solve these problems. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to comment on the post! Some I will admittedly look up if I get stuck. I am still learning and don't have all the answers, but seeing (sometimes) complex questions and answers is beneficial. In cases where I do look up the answer, I will link to the solution I used above the solution's code block.
